        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>Upper Crust Bakery is a specialty bakery focused on handcrafted pastries and fresh baked goods. Known for quality ingredients and classic recipes, the bakery serves customers seeking both everyday treats and specialty desserts.</p>
        <p>The brand identity reflects freshness, approachability, and a modern take on traditional baking.</p>

    <h2>Visual Strategy</h2>
    <p>Because the logo and brand colors were already established, the focus shifted to applying the identity in a way that felt intentional and elevated. The goal was to create packaging that reinforced brand recognition while enhancing the customer experience.</p>
    <p>I considered how bakery packaging functions in real life. It needs to be sturdy, easy to carry, and visually appealing both in-store and in transit. The box needed to feel fresh and inviting while clearly communicating the product inside. Emphasis was placed on clarity, color balance, and scale to ensure the logo remained the focal point without overwhelming the design.</p>
    <p>To guide the aesthetic direction, I looked at contemporary bakery packaging trends, particularly those that balance playful food imagery with clean, modern layouts. The aim was to keep the design appetizing and recognizable without feeling cluttered.</p>

        <h2>Packaging Development</h2>
        <p>The box structure was designed with both practicality and visual presence in mind. A built-in handle allows for easy transport, while the angled top creates dimension and visual interest. The brand’s green and blue tones were extended across the structural elements, creating contrast between the exterior surfaces and interior folds.</p>
        <p>The front panel prominently features the Upper Crust Bakery logo, paired with a blueberry icon to reinforce product association. A cropped image of a lattice pie was incorporated to add warmth and realism without overwhelming the composition. This balance between illustration and photography helps the packaging feel approachable and premium at the same time.</p>
        <p>The background pattern of blueberries enhances brand recognition while subtly reinforcing the bakery’s offerings. The repetition adds texture and depth without distracting from the primary branding.</p>

        <h2>Final Execution</h2>
        <p>The final packaging design delivers a cohesive and functional solution that aligns with the existing brand identity. It enhances shelf presence, strengthens brand recall, and creates an engaging unboxing experience for customers.</p>
        <p>The result is a carryout box that is both practical and visually memorable, supporting Upper Crust Bakery’s commitment to quality and presentation.</p>
