    <h2>Visual Strategy</h2>
    <p>Carter and Co needed a menu refresh to stay modern and relevant while appealing to a broader audience, including younger diners, without alienating their loyal clientele. To guide the redesign, I researched well-known steakhouses to analyze layouts, color schemes, and visual approaches that successfully balance tradition and contemporary style.</p>
    <p>The visual direction focused on clear hierarchy, readable typography, and warm, inviting colors that reflect the restaurant’s quality and approachable atmosphere. This strategy ensured the menu feels both current and welcoming, supporting Carter and Co’s goal of attracting new diners while retaining existing patrons.</p>

        <h2>Menu Design</h2>
        <p>The menu layout was designed to clearly organize a variety of dishes while reflecting Carter and Co’s modern yet classic steakhouse aesthetic. Sections were structured with hierarchy in mind, using typography and spacing to make it easy for diners to scan and navigate.</p>
        <p>Typography choices were selected to balance sophistication and readability, pairing serif fonts for headings with clean, approachable type for menu items. Visual elements, such as subtle lines, dividers, and accents, were incorporated to guide the eye and reinforce the premium yet welcoming atmosphere.</p>
        <p>During the design process, I considered adding images of entrees but decided against it, as photos can often feel cheap or cluttered. Instead, the menu relies on layout, typography, and carefully chosen accents to communicate quality and appeal.</p>

        <h2>Final Execution</h2>
        <p>The completed menu combines clean hierarchy, readable typography, and a warm, inviting color palette to create a design that feels both modern and classic. Subtle visual accents guide the eye without distracting from the food offerings, while the structured layout ensures diners can easily navigate the selections.</p>
        <p>No food photography was included, maintaining a sophisticated look and letting the design itself convey quality and professionalism.</p>
        <p>The deliverables include the full menu layout, ready for print and digital use, with a cohesive design that aligns with the restaurant’s brand and appeals to both loyal patrons and new, younger diners.</p>
