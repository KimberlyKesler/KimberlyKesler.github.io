    <h2>Visual Strategy</h2>
    <p>Because Future Funds already had an established logo, color palette, and typography system, a traditional mood board was not necessary. Instead, the focus shifted toward research and user experience strategy. I studied the websites and mobile platforms of well-known banks and financial institutions to identify effective layout patterns, navigation systems, and content hierarchy.</p>
    <p>One consistent theme among leading institutions was simplicity. The most successful platforms prioritized clean layouts, clear calls to action, and straightforward navigation. This became a guiding principle for Future Funds. The interface needed to feel trustworthy, modern, and easy to use for a wide range of users, from younger clients managing investments to older clients tracking savings.</p>
    <p>The visual strategy centered on clarity, structure, and accessibility, ensuring that both the website and app would be intuitive and user friendly across all age groups.</p>

        <h2>Wireframe Development</h2>
        <p>The wireframing process began with the homepage, as it establishes the first impression and overall structure for the platform. Through research, I observed that many successful financial institutions utilize a strong hero section with large, clear headlines and direct calls to action. This approach builds immediate trust while guiding users toward key actions.</p>
        <p>I implemented a prominent hero area paired with concise messaging and clearly defined buttons to prioritize usability and clarity. The navigation bar was intentionally kept simple and straightforward, limiting options to essential categories to reduce cognitive load.</p>
        <p>This emphasis on clarity and structure guided every design decision that followed. Each subsequent page and app screen maintained consistent hierarchy and clean spacing to ensure users could manage savings without confusion.</p>

        <h2>App Development</h2>
        <p>The mobile app structure was designed to reflect the same clarity and simplicity established in the website wireframe while adapting to a smaller screen environment. Key features such as account balances, investment performance, and growth tracking were positioned prominently on the dashboard for immediate visibility.</p>
        <p>To maintain a clean interface, the primary navigation remained minimal, featuring a search icon and user account icon for quick access. A hamburger menu was incorporated to provide expanded navigation options through a flyout panel with dropdown selections. This approach allowed the interface to stay uncluttered while still giving users access to all necessary tools and features.</p>

        <h2>Final Execution</h2>
        <p>The completed website wireframe establishes a structured digital foundation for Future Funds. The homepage introduces the brand with a clear value proposition and direct action pathways, while interior pages are organized to support seamless movement between savings, investments, and growth tracking tools.</p>
        <p>The mobile app translates this framework into a streamlined, touch friendly experience. Core financial data is centralized within the dashboard, while secondary tools are accessible through an expandable menu system. Together, the website and app form a cohesive digital ecosystem that positions Future Funds as organized, modern, and ready for implementation.</p>
