        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hey Y’all.<br>Ever since I was a child, I have always been drawn to creativity. Whether it was creating custom pictures for my friends or selling stationery sets door to door in second grade, I knew that my passion for design would shape my future. Before pursuing my formal education at Southern New Hampshire University, I delved into custom designing with machine embroidery, monogramming apparel, and creating custom embroidered birth stat cloth diapers. Over time, I have honed my skills in illustrating graphics for small business branding and church events. I have developed a strong interest in branding and marketing through printed materials and social media graphics. I take pleasure in working with businesses that uphold strong morals and values, prioritizing purpose above all else. By working closely with each client, I aim not only to design something tailored to their needs but also to gain a deep understanding of the community they serve. My inspiration comes from the intricacies of everyday life: heartfelt conversations and stories with loved ones, the comforting colors of a warm cup of coffee and a blueberry bagel, the pure joy of watching puppies play in the park. All of these elements remind me of God’s love and the beauty of the world He has created for us.</p>
